// Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.
// The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for
// which the edge between nodes i and j exists. Each node is an integer between
// 0 and graph.length 1. There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i]
// does not contain i, and it doesnâ€™t contain any element twice.
// Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
// Output: true
