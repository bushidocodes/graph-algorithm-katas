// A maze will be given by a 2d integer matrix(int [][]) that only contains 1s
// and 0s. 1 indicates a block that you cannot pass and 0 indicates a clear
// space that you can pass from.
// You should implement a program that reads the given matrix and takes any two
// points as inputs and tells whether there is a path in this maze between such
// points. Note that index starts at 0 for the points. For example, given the
// start point (1, 1) and the end point (1, 8), your program outputs ‘YES’ if
// there exists at least one clear path between them and ‘NO’ if no path exists.
